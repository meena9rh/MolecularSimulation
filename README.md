Dr. M. Hamilton created this repository. The script included here simulates molecules in a given number of frames. 
This was mainly created to simulate Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) imaging data, but it can also be used for other systems like Live Imaging and single-molecule FRET.

The script was created using Python 3.9 and to run it, install the anaconda environment provided here (called menv.yml).
